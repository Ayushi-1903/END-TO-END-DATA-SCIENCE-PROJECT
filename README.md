# Description of the Task 3 end to end data science Project:
This task involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their scores in subjects like Python, C Programming, DSA, and DMP. A dataset containing student performance is loaded and preprocessed, converting the result into a binary "Pass" label. After selecting relevant features and handling missing values, the data is split into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Classifier is then trained and saved as a .pkl file for future use.
This project is a complete web-based Student Performance Forecast System built using Flask, enabling pass/fail prediction, user interaction, feedback management, and administrative review.

Key components:

Student Performance Prediction: Users enter scores for Python, C Programming, DSA, and DMP. A basic rule-based function computes the average and predicts whether the student will pass (average â‰¥ 50) or fail. The result is displayed with individual scores, total marks, and a success probability.

Interactive Web Interface: A visually appealing Index.html form allows students to submit their details. Post-submission, the site dynamically presents personalized insights and results, with icons and color-coded visuals enhancing the user experience.

Feedback Form: A dedicated /feedback route renders feedback.html, where users can share their opinions. The feedback data (name, email, message) is saved in a feedback.csv file within a secure directory (feedback_data), ensuring organized storage.

Thank You Page: After submitting feedback, users are redirected to a stylish thank_you.html page with animations and confetti effects to acknowledge and celebrate user participation.

Admin Panel: The /admin route displays all collected feedback in a tabular format using admin_panel.html. Admins can review user inputs to understand engagement and improve the system.

Overall, the project combines predictive logic, user-friendly design, file handling, and administrative tools into a cohesive educational application.
